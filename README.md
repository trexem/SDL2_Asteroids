# SDL2_TEST
Testing and playing with SDL2

You need to have installed SDL2 libraries, I'm using `g++` compiler in `cygwin64` and `make` command to compile. But there're tutorials for you to install SDL2 with MingW32, Codeblocks or whatever

## Testing
Download the `/release` folder and run `sdl_test.exe`
